--Notes--
-We have one more body column than header 
 column on our dashboard
-I see us headed for another issue; we have the day
 a user starts the account, and that is what Phoung is
 currently ordering by, but if we are going to want to 
 generally reference the date the subscription is due to 
 be renewed it may be wise to add that as an attribute to 
 the subscription model. This would allow us to be able to
 calculate it twice at it's creation and it's renewal rather
 than having to worry about working it out in templating for every
 subscription each time a page is loaded.









--To_Do--
-new subscription validator
    -ensure no duplicate subscription entry exists
