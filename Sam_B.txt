--Notes--
-monthly_rate regex not comfirmed talk to Mei
-confirm hidden input for add/edit_subscription integrated properly

-I've got two delete_subscription buttons in my editSubscription.html

-confirm password on registration is still not obscured

-Please note that the mainstream companies we intend to have images 
 and stored information for must be managed via the admin panel
    -to show up in the companies drop-down they must be checked for 
     entered_by_admin

-We have one more body column than header 
 column on our dashboard









--To_Do--
-if we decide to include the renew function we may need to expand it 
 such that we can allow for price changes at the time of renewal to 
 better accomodate the building of an accurate new datapoint and to update the 
 renew_by_date
