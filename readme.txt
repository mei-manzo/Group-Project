A Subscription-Tracker app built in Python using the Django framework. The app, basically, does what it says: organizes and lists users' subscriptions for easier tracking of renewable fees. This app was developed by our team of five developers over the course of about ten days. 

Functionality includes a login and registration app, which gatekeeps the website. Upon signing in, the user will enter the dashboard. From there, user can add their subscriptions to be tracked, either from a dropdown menu of over twenty popular subscriptions or by adding their own. Each of the preloaded subscriptions comes equipped with an image chip of the company logo for added visual appeal. 

Once subscriptions are added to the database, the user may then view their collection of subscriptions in the dashboard and organize them in a variety of ways. Each column in the subscription table includes an ordering button; which allows the user to view subscriptions from ascending to descending; or vice versa; allowing, for example, for easy perusal of one's most expensive subscriptions. 

The app also supports pagination, allowing for better readability for many subscriptions. 

Users may also edit any of their subscriptions by going to the "Edit" setting, which allows them to update any aspect of their subscription. User may return to the homepage at any time by clicking on the "Subscription Tracker" logo at the top left corner of the site.
